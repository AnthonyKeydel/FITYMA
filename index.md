# Fake It 'Till You Make It

A design assignment for CSCI 3002: Foundations of Human-Computer Interaction.

We designed an app that would record your mood, and prompt you to enter in something positive in your life. 
This would help people form positive thinking habits, as well as keep track of their mood.

### Project by:
* Anthony Keydel   |   [AnthonyKeydel@colorado.edu](mailto:AnthonyKeydel@colorado.edu)
* Kyle Faucher     |   kyfa3283@colorado.edu
* Jacob Heller     |   jahe4067@colorado.edu

You can find our design documents in [our shared Google Drive folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DvnZiXmrA9gZa9MRPTe5XoLIlBV-TXkd?usp=sharing)  
We used the prototyping tool Figma. Feel free to [try out our design !](https://www.figma.com/file/DEClNdggGmtuoC18Kt58aqHq/Final-Prototype)
